# dotfiles

Some dotfiles of mine that I use. Feel free to critique my font choice, though don't be too harsh. :P
With the exception of fonts, keeping it simple stupid is the name of the game here. Too large of a deviation
from defaults is undesirable, usually making things more needlessly complex in both workflow and configuration;
which is undesirable at large. This also ensures a lesser overall maintenance burden.
