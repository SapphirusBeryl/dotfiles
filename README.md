# dotfiles

Located herein within this repository are Xavier's dotfiles.

At present, I've not decided on a dotfile manager with which to organize and deploy these files.
But if you have a recommendation, shout one out at me and I'd be happy to entertain the thought.

Feel free to critique my font choice, though don't be too harsh. ðŸ¤ª Nevertheless, with the exception of fonts, 
keeping it simple stupid is the name of the game here. Too large of a deviation from defaults is undesirable,
usually making things more needlessly complex than necessary, in both workflow and maintainability.
